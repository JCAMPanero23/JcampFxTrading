Found a critical bug. 

Based on the images the last 3 trades, got the same Protection trigger happened with +2.63R 

also the  PROTECTION TRIGGERED!  and  CLOSING POSITION FOR REPLACEMENT happened at the same time.  i think its creates a confusion?


For Context: 
I changed the Gave back to 100% and changes the age before protection activates to 60min.

additionally: 
Can you check if the TP trails after the trail activated. because its seems to be stack after 1 TP trails.
